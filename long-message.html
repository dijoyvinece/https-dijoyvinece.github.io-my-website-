      My love, mahal, jelo, lovelove, baby,<br><br>
      From the moment you entered my life, everything became softer, warmer,
      and more meaningful. Every smile of yours feels like home, and every
      moment with you is something I treasure deeply.
      <br><br>
      Thank you for loving me, choosing me, and staying with me.
      I promise to keep loving you in every way I can—today, tomorrow,
      and always.
      <br><br>
      Happy Anniversary, my heart. I love you very much😚🥰❤️
